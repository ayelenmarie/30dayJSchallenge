    <p>Getting lost is the occurrence of a person or animal losing spatial reference. This situation consists of two
      elements: the feeling of disorientation and a spatial component. While getting lost, being lost or totally
      lost, etc. are popular expressions for someone in a desperate situation (perhaps not literally lost), getting
      lost is also a positive term for a goal some travellers have in exploring without a plan</p>
    <p>Psychology and neuroscience help to understand the underlying processes which take place before, during and
      after getting lost. Getting lost is an aspect of behavioral geography, in which human wayfinding and cognitive
      and environmental factors play a role. For successful travel, it is necessary to be able to identify origin and
      destination, to determine turn angles, to identify segment lengths and directions of movement, to recognize on
      route and distant landmarks. This information is required to plot a course designed to reach a destination
      (previously known or unknown) or to return to a home base after wandering. If a destination is known but is not
      directly connected by a path, road, or track to the origin, successful travel may involve search and exploration,
      spatial updating of one's location, finding familiar landmarks, recognition of segment length and sequencing,
      identification of a frame of reference. Human movement is often guided by external aids (cartographic maps,
      charts, compasses, pedometers, and the like).</p>

    <p>Getting lost is particularly problematic for children (who have not yet developed tools and strategies for
      maintaining their bearings) and for the elderly, particularly those experiencing the onset of dementia. Such
      individuals "can get lost while trying to find their local shop â€“ due to their diminishing memory they can forget
      where the shop is, or where they live and why they went out of their house in the first place". People
      experiencing dementia also get lost more easily in poor visibility conditions because the mind fails to
      appropriately fill in cues as to missing landmarks. Getting lost in unfamiliar terrain can lead even an adult
      with a healthy mind to panic and engage in unthinking behaviors that make the situation even worse. The
      tendency of the mind to seek patterns and familiar signs can contribute to this in two ways. First the lost
      person may mistake features of the terrain for markers that were seen before they became lost, creating a false
      sense of orientation that may lead the lost person to pursue routes that take them even further off course.
      Second, the lost person may mistake such features for markers that were seen after they became lost, creating a
      false sense that they have made a circle and returned to an earlier point of their effort to find their bearings.</p>
    <p>There have been some historically notable instances of people getting lost and either being rescued or dying.
      George Shannon, the youngest adult member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition got lost on two occasions after being
      separated from the expedition. On August 26, 1804, he was sent to retrieve two pack horses; he was separated from
      the party for sixteen days and nearly starved, as he went without food for twelve days except for some grapes and
      rabbits. At first he thought he was behind the expedition, so he sped up thinking he could catch up. Then,
      getting hungry, he went downstream to look for a trading party he could stay with. Finally John Colter was sent
      to find him. The second time was on August 6, 1805, when the expedition was at the Three Forks. Shannon was
      dispatched up a fork the party had named Wisdom (the middle fork was named Jefferson and the placid fork,
      Philanthropy). He rejoined the party after three days by backtracking to the forks and following the trail of the
      others.</p>

    <p>John Muir wrote in his journals of an occasion when a visiting artist named Billy Simms "went forth to sketch
      while I was among the glaciers, and got lost - was thirty-six hours without food". Mentally ailing Church of
      England mission priest Alexander Mackonochie died after getting lost on December 14, 1887, while walking in the
      Forest of Mamore, near Loch Leven, Scotland: the circumstances were later commemorated in a poem by William
      McGonagall. In September 2014, Soviet and Russian mathematician Alexey Chervonenkis got lost in Losiny Ostrov
      National Park; a later search operation found him dead near Mytishchi, a suburb of Moscow.</p>
    <p>People are sometimes depicted in fiction and literature as getting lost, with substantial consequences. For
      example, due to "the physical structure of Rome, whose streets were notoriously labyrinthine", it has been
      observed that "getting lost in Rome was staple of travel narratives". The experience of getting lost is also
      a commonly reported theme of dreams.</p>
